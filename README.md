## Motivation

This repository emerged from my journey writing survey papers, where I encountered numerous exceptional academic works featuring elegant illustrations and well-designed tables. I started collecting these visualization examples not just for my own reference, but to share them with the broader academic community.

I believe that exploring and experimenting with these LaTeX codes offers a valuable learning experience. By studying and adapting these examples, we can better understand the art of academic visualization and continuously improve our own design skills.

While this repository begins modestly with a select few plots and tables, it will grow organically alongside my research journey. I'm committed to regularly updating it with new discoveries and creations, making it a living resource that evolves with the community's needs and contributions.
